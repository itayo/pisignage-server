###Points to remember

1.angularjs-dropdown-multiselect is taken directly from   
    https://github.com/dotansimha/angularjs-dropdown-multiselect/pull/23/files instead of bower (for close-on-select to work)  

2.Requires following programs to work  
    - ffmpeg >= 0.9  (in certain Os, these may have to be compiled since the package does not exist, 
      please see the issue #9, it is not that scary!)   
    - ffprobe associated with ffmpeg needed to convert videos    
    - imagemagick  creates thumbnails
    
3.Two directories are created by the program ../media and ../media/_thumbnails. If these directories are not created server won't work as expected (for e.g. thumbnails won't be created if _thumbnails directory does not exit). In that case create those directories manually.


####You can also manage players using Browser(http://playerip:8000) or downloading Chrome app  

    
####The code is still in early release, Please raise an issue for problems or send an email to info@pisignage.com
